                        <p>
                            The Academy structure is different from a normal school day. In a relaxed atmosphere,
                            students will have a unique opportunity to finish their academic classes through an
                            online curriculum. This will allow each student to work at his/her own pace with
                            instructors ready to assist at all times. The Academy can provide ways to finish credits,
                            pass proficiencies, and help students graduate on time. There are teachers, a student
                            success advocate, and a counselor who all work with our students, keeping the class-size
                            one-to-one, and optimizing a student's potential for success.
                        </p>

                            A student’s success in the Academy is vital to graduation, and our Academy team
                            is highly committed to helping students reach that goal through the Academy pathway.

                        As a sophomore at Legacy High School, Audiel realized that he was headed in a direction
                        he did not want to go. Part of the problem was the friends that he hung around with.
                        Audiel was determined that the best thing for him to do was to separate himself from
                        his friends by going to a different school. This decision was made easier with the
                        support of his girlfriend Angel. She, too, realized that her future was in jeopardy
                        and that a change needed to be made. Both Audiel and Angel enrolled at Mojave last
                        year as juniors and Audiel improved his GPA from 0.89 for his sophomore year to a
                        3.18 for his junior year. Entering the Mojave Academy this year Audiel needed to
                        complete his regular senior classes as well as make up credits from his freshman
                        and sophomore years. The total of classes that he needed to finish was 10. Because
                        of changes that were made at the beginning of second semester that total became 12.
                        Audiel has worked diligently in the Academy completing on average 2 classes per
                        month. He has been an example to his peers for what could be done when roadblocks
                        are removed and learning is streamlined with an online curriculum. Audiel’s plan
                        now is to attend CSN and pursue a degree in Music Technology. As the Academy staff,
                        we wish you well Audiel and expect that Angel will not be far behind you. We wish
                        you success in all of your future endeavors.

                        The Academy really helped me get back on track to graduate. When I entered this
                        school, I was super behind on credits, but now I am going to graduate early. If
                        you don’t understand your work , the teachers in the academy will help you with
                        it; they are super reliable. If you are behind on credits, you need to come to
                        the academy and do your work and graduate early.

                        The Academy is a great opportunity for students who are behind on credits.
                        It has allowed me to expand my confidence and learning experience on many
                        levels. Therefore, it allows me to catch up on valuable time of education

                        I’ve been in the Academy since Aug. 2015. I gotta say that this has been the
                        best year of school for me by far. Being in the Academy has been such a great
                        experience because it has allowed me to work on my classes freely and has
                        given me the opportunity to graduate early. The computer classes are not
                        hard to get done and the teachers in the Academy are really amazing. The
                        Academy has been the best thing to ever happen to me in all my years at school.

                        <img class="pull-left portrait" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jwmay/mhs-academy-website/gh-pages/img/faculty/lybbert.jpg">
                        Mr. Lybbert was born in Denver, Colorado to become the third oldest of nine
                        kids. Mr. Lybbert's dad David Lybbert got a degree in microbiology from Colorado
                        State University but did not go into the field of microbiology. After college
                        David tried a number of different jobs that took the family all over the Western
                        United States. Mr. Lybbert changed schools nine times, in three different states
                        before he finally graduated. Mr. Lybbert attended two different high schools. One
                        in Riverside California called Ramona High School with a student population in
                        the thousands. However, he transferred in his senior year to Rye High School with
                        a student population of 201 students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Lybbert did not immediately go to college himself. He first served a mission
                        for his church in Alberta, Canada for two years. During his time in Alberta,
                        Mr. Lybbert developed a fondness for Canada – especially the hard working farmers,
                        ranchers, and oil workers he found on the rolling plains of Southern Alberta.
                        It is no surprise that Mr. Lybbert would develop a special connection with
                        these people since his father David Milby Lybbert, his grandfather John Milby
                        Lybbert, and his great grandfather John Isaac Lybbert all worked as blacksmiths
                        and cowboys in the same area specifically Cardston, Alberta. In fact Mr. Lybbert's
                        father, born an American citizen in Utah, had lived his entire life in Alberta
                        until he left to go on a mission when he was 19 to Liverpool, England. Mr. Lybbert
                        still visits Alberta, Canada as often as he can to enjoy the beautiful country there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing his mission and returning to the United States Mr. Lybbert
                        enrolled at Riverside Community College in Riverside, CA. Due to the fact that
                        Mr. Lybbert's high school career was less than stellar he had to work very hard
                        to catch up to where he needed to be for college. It was during this time that
                        he met and married a woman Angela Rannalli and they had their first son in March
                        of 2001. After three years at RCC, Mr. Lybbert received his Associates of Science
                        degree and earned a GPA high enough to transfer to Califronia Polytechnic
                        University - San Luis Obispo to pursue his bachelor's degree. While at Cal Poly
                        San Luis Obispo, Mr. and Mrs. Lybbert had their second son in September of 2003.
                        By March of 2005, Mr. Lybbert had earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Biology
                        and had been accepted to the Southern California College of Optometry in Fullerton
                        California. The Lybbert family moved to Fullerton in August of 2005 to get ready
                        for this next chapter in Mr. Lybbert's education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his time at SCCO Mr. Lybbert often tutored high school students and helped
                        his fellow students who did not have a background in biology to get through many
                        of the science classes. He recognized that there was often a disconnect between
                        what the teacher was saying in lecture and what students were understanding. This
                        was the first time that Mr. Lybbert seriously considered teaching at some point
                        in his life. He finished his first year of Optometry School with a 3.4 GPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the strain of his educational demands and the conflicting personalities
                        of Mr. Lybbert and his wife Angela they filed for divorce in 2007. The split
                        was harder to take than Mr. Lybbert expected and his schooling suffered. By
                        2008 Mr. Lybbert's poor performance had resulted in the school dismissing him
                        from the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Lybbert continued to work in various optometry and ophthalmology offices
                        for the next couple of years as a technician doing a lot of the testing he
                        had learned in optometry school. It was during this time that he met and
                        married Lisa Child. Lisa had just finished her masters in education and was
                        looking for a job in elementary education. She was able to find just such a
                        job in Las Vegas, and Mr. Lybbert followed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the suggestion of his wife and remembering how he enjoyed teaching his
                        classmates, Mr. Lybbert began a masters program in education. He finished in
                        December of 2011 and was hired by Mojave High School in August 2012. Mr. Lybbert
                        has taught Biology and Chemistry in the last three years here at Mojave and is
                        currently the science teacher in the Mojave Academy. Mojave reminds Mr. Lybbert
                        of his own high school experiences and wants nothing more than to help his
                        students so that they will not have to travel the same hard road he did in
                        order to graduate from college. Mr. Lybbert loves science but has also become
                        very interested in archeology and etymology. He feels that he finds a lot of
                        our own modern problems in ancient societies and hopes to learn from their
                        mistakes.

                        “out-of-the-box” strategies to create different learning environments for
                        student success dates back to 2000, when she first came to Vegas. The VIP
                        program at Valley HS that her team created won the CCSD Excellence in Education
                        Award in 2006 for reducing the dropout rate and increasing the proficiency and
                        graduation rate for her students. Taking that experience to Texas, she taught
                        SAT prep and tutored non-proficient seniors in science with a 100% passing
                        rate--along with other classes. Maybe this ability to “roll” with challenges
                        is because her B.A. was in Choral Music, with a minor in English, and her M.Ed.
                        is in Curriculum and Instruction, leaving her with thousands of ideas bouncing
                        around in her head. Always on the lookout for innovative educational ideas,

                        training. But Victoria is never one to look at the past with regret; in fact,
                        her core belief is one of looking at the future and limitless opportunities.
                        So, when she had to stop nursing school, she started working for CCSD, first
                        as a kitchen manager, and then as a Specialized Programs Teacher Assistant.
                        From those jobs, she came to Mojave, where she has been Mr. Wells’ secretary
                        for two years, and everyone in The Academy-which she loves- knows she will
                        help anybody with whatever they need!  A Business Management degree is in her
                        future now, as well, as she pursues a degree with all the energy she puts into
                        everything she does. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victoria has a “happy place” at home after a busy day in The Academy,
                        repurposing antique furniture. Many great hours are also spent in the
                        outdoors with her husband, unless she is reading a great new book. So,
                        look at Victoria for a second glance: she has achieved her dreams and
                        will continue to look forward with an eye on achieving any goal she
                        chooses.

                        Everybody needs an advocate, someone who is in their corner encouraging them
                        to keep going. In The Academy, that person is Kelly Flores, our Student
                        Success Advocate. She is well suited to this position, but it has been a
                        long journey to get here. After getting her BA in Music Ed at Wayne State
                        University and teaching at the Detroit School for Fine Arts for three years,
                        she made her way to Las Vegas.

                        She married Jeff and settled down to raise her two children, Jenna and Jayden.
                        Life was good. But life changes, and she began teaching again in 4th, then 5th,
                        then 1st grades. ELL was happy to have her nurturing presence for about 7 years,
                        and then she moved on for 2 years in CCSD’s Homeless Outreach program. But she
                        has found a niche at Mojave, where she can combine her creativity with her
                        compassionate nature to help our students be successful.

                        In her spare time, she enjoys playing guitar with her son, playing the flute,
                        and riding horses. Catch her on the trail, if you can, and she will be an
                        advocate for you, too.

                        Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Tim Wells graduated from the University
                        of Cincinnati with his BS in Secondary Education, BA in English, and a Masters
                        in Secondary Education. He earned his leadership for secondary education from
                        Jacksonville State University. He also earned his Specialist in Secondary
                        Education from Georgia State University. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He began his teaching career in Stone Mountain, Georgia. After earning Teacher
                        of the Year among first year teachers, he began working with AP Language courses.
                        Through his success and leadership potential, he began to oversee the AP program.
                        He earned multiple Teacher of the Year awards and STAR teacher awards. With such
                        success in the AP Program, Mr. Wells was promoted to Assistant Principal to open
                        an environmentally themed high school, Arabia Mountain. He led the writing of
                        the curriculum and quickly gained national attention with the EIC model
                        (Environment as an Integrated Curriculum). The school quickly moved to the top
                        three schools in the state of Georgia for test scores and graduation rates.
                        Having received numerous awards from a multitude of agencies, Mr. Wells decided
                        to move to Las Vegas to seek new adventures on improving graduation rates,
                        especially for minority students.

                        At Mojave High School, he was the Dean of Students during the 2014–2015 school
                        year. During this time he saw an opportunity to create an academy, where it
                        would house students most at risk of not successfully completing high school.
                        Upon promotion to Assistant Principal this current year, the concept of the
                        Academy came to be. Proud to lead such an endeavor, Mr. Wells is excited to
                        see so many students completing missed classes and to witness students feel
                        hope returning to their lives as they can graduate.
